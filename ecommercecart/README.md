#HI EVERYBODY! 

#React.JS Ecommerce-Cart App

In this Little Project/practice I practiced: 

- useState Hooks
- passing Props
- implementing some dependencies such as react-router-dom(amazing)
- and basic app structuring

It's followed up by some basic CSS style.


(And if you want to go into the app, go through "ecommercecart" folder.

Stay Amazing.
